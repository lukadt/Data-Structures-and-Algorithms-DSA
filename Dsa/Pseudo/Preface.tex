\chapter*{Preface}
Throughout the history of programming effeciency has always been key, with respect to both time (runtime - fow which we use big Oh notation) and space (memory) this makes choosing the correct data structures and algorithms in a project vital to it's success, the wrong selection can result in adverse affects - worse it may lose you your customer base!

The premise of this free book is to fill the void, to provide information that allows you to select the right data structures and algorithms within your given context. While it is attributed that we cannot give you 1:1 counselling we can, however, provide you with the required knowledge in order for you to make educated decisions.

Throughout this book you will find annotations littered with advise that we have found useful with respect to that algorithm or data structure - this advise is based on our own experiences and at times no doubt it is very subjective, but it should (hopefully!) still provoke thought from the reader.

Most of the work in this book is based on the work we carried out on the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)\footnote{\url{http://codeplex.com/dsa}} library. DSA was built using C\# and the .NET platform and serves as a project for all the things that we felt .NET was missing with respect to core data structures and algorithms - choice is always imperative in many scenarios, this itself was a driving factor, we wanted to provide the programmer with more choice.

\section*{Intended Use}
This book serves purely as a reference for those who are wanting to get a quick overview of the data structures and algorithms listed, as well as having a tried and tested implementation in the form of pseudocode to port to the readers imperative\footnote{You can also use this book for functional languages, however you will need to inject idioms that are core to that paradigm to create well structured functional alternatives of the work listed in this book.} language of choice.
