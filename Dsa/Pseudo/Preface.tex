\chapter*{Preface}
Every book has a story as to how it came about and this one is no different, however we would be lying if we said its development was not somewhat impromptu. Put simply this book is a result of a series of emails sent between the two authors during the development of a library for the .NET framework of the same name (with the omission of the subtitle). The conversation started off something like ``Why don't we create a more aesthetically pleasing way to present the pseudo code that we have?'' After a few weeks this new aesthetically pleasing way to show our pseudo code had in fact grown into pseudo code listings with chunks of text describing how it works and various other things and so we though ``what the heck, lets make this thing into a book!'' And so, in the summer of 2008 we began work on this book side by side with the actual implementation.
