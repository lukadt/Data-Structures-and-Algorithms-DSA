\section*{Preface}
This book consists of annotated pseudocode that was used when designing the algorithms which are contained in DSA\footnote{\url{http://codeplex.com/dsa}}. In DSA all implementations are in C\# \footnote{\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/default.aspx}}.

The designs provided here serve as a reference for those who want to port well designed and tested implementations of common (and uncommon) data structures and algorithms to their imperative language of choice.
